* integration testing
* non structured inputs
* test with many inputs (docker, kubernetes, ls, df)
* detection of right aligned columns
* ability to preview column detection (--peek)
* ability to specify column indices (-c[0,15,17,24,45])
* print version info
* filter lines (where a=b)
* filter by numeric comparison (where a<b)
* filter by date (a<b)
* use sqlite for more complex queries (group by, having, aggregate functions)
